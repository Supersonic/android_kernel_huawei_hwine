	  Make walt_ravg_window tunable in early param.

	help
	  Schedutil governor migrate cpu busy time when task migrate. This
	  option will recaculate a lower load for task downmigrate to
	  prevent little core's frequency increase too much.

config SCHED_HISI_CALC_CUM_WINDOW_DEMAND
	bool "WALT calculate cum window demand"

	  This option caculates WALT's cum_window_demand, which is not used
	  currently.

	depends on SCHED_WALT
	default n
	help
	  WALT caculates an irqload for each cpu and scheduler will avoid
	  placing task on a high irqload cpu (if WALT enabled).
	  Default disabled because we haven't tested to find out which
	  threshold is the best.

	  This option enables calculation of WALT's task demand and rq
	  cumulative runnable avg.

	  Say N if WALT signal is not used in scheduler. There might be a
	  little cost for WALT task demand update.
	  If selected, control sysctl_sched_use_walt_cpu_util and
	  sysctl_sched_use_walt_task_util to use it in cpu_util and
	  task_util.
